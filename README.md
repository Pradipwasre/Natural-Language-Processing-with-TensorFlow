# Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow

 Natural language processing (NLP) supplies the majority of data available to deep learning applications, while TensorFlow is the most important deep learning framework currently available.

Natural language is a broad term but you can consider it to cover any of the following:
    * Text (such as that contained in an email, blog post, book, Tweet)
    * Speech (a conversation you have with a doctor, voice commands you give to a smart speaker)
